The usage is simpler as the keywords field is disabled by default. And the Wordpress excerpts can be turned of for descriptions.

= Can I turn the keywords field back on? =

Yes you can. Check out 'Add keywords field to post editing screen' in plugin options.

= Why would anyone want to turn of the Wordpress excerpts for the descriptions? =

If you are doing some custom stuff (for example) with your templates, it might come handy. We need it.

It's all there.
