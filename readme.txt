== Changelog ==

= Version 1.6.26 - 27 May 2015 =

* Feature - Wordpress Seo by Yoast import function
* Feature - XML Sitemaps & Google News feed plugin support - use our plugin to include/exclude categories and authors from XML sitemap
* Improvement - hAtom microformats (.hentry element class inserted by Wordpress) removed by default. hEntry is a microformat declaration which makes sure Google reads your post tags better, but we turn it off by default to keep the site structured data clean - only add what you really need.
* Improvement - Open Graph - added checking for duplicate images in og:image tag
* Improvement - Open Graph - only featured image and 2 widest images from content will be used (Facebook only picks the biggest images from Open Graph)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= So what's the advantage of this plugin over the original All in One SEO Pack ? =

The usage is simpler as the keywords field is disabled by default. And the Wordpress excerpts can be turned of for descriptions.

= Can I turn the keywords field back on? =

Yes you can. Check out 'Add keywords field to post editing screen' in plugin options.

= Why would anyone want to turn of the Wordpress excerpts for the descriptions? =

If you are doing some custom stuff (for example) with your templates, it might come handy. We need it.

= What about the rest of the original plugin functionality? =

It's all there.
